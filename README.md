## How to add stuff
1. Make a branch using git checkout -b (your_branch_name)
OR using GitHub desktop. This means all your work wont change what the current working game is, but you will be able to get the latest changes to the game.
2. Add your work to your branch
3. Commit and push your work to your branch
4. go to github.com to our repository and create a pull request in the format main <-- (your branch)
5. Everyone can check your work from here, and GitHub will show any potential conflicts. If there is none we can merge them right away. If there are some we can check easily.
