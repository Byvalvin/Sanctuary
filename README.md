## How to add stuff
1. Do a git pull to get the latest changes.
2. Make a branch using git checkout -b (your_branch_name)
OR using GitHub desktop. This means all your work wont change what the current working game is, but you will be able to get the latest changes to the game.
3. Add your work to your branch (DO NOT EDIT OTHER MAPS IN THE GAME. MAKE A NEW MAP)
4. Commit and push your work to your branch
5. go to github.com to our repository and create a pull request in the format main <-- (your branch)
6. Everyone can check your work from here, and GitHub will show any potential conflicts. If there is none we can merge them right away. If there are some we can check easily.
7. Once your pull request is approved delete your branch. You won't lose your work because its all on the main branch.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 to continue to add to the project.
